										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scent of the springtime flowers, lilacs are known for their delicate and pleasant fragrance. These plants grow wild in many regions around the world which means they can be easily grown at home! They provide a calming effect that assists with insomnia as well when diffused into aromatherapy. This floral aroma is great to add some freshness or relaxation back into your life!<br />
Unfortunately, this wonderful flower cannot be processed to make essential oil, but instead of making a synthetic oil, we use Syringa Vulgaris which is a lilac variety discovered in the early 20th century. It can be distilled, it is natural, aromatic, soft, and very similar to the lilac that you could have in your garden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The geranium essential oil has been used for centuries as a treatment for anxiety and is one of the best-known oils in Aromatherapy. It was originally extracted from plants around 1790 by a French physician who was looking for treatments that would help relieve stress levels among his patients. Today it is not uncommon to see ingredients with this aromatic scent included in many popular products such as soaps or lotions. In fact, some brands even use geranium exclusively because they believe its therapeutic properties are more cost-effective than expensive alternatives like lavender.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mimosa essential oil is derived from the leaves and stems of sage plants. When the production of organic herbs began, it began to be cultivated in Spain, being one of the countries that currently has the highest quality sage. It has been used for centuries to promote mental clarity, purify the airways, and relieve muscle cramps, among other things. Sage&#8217;s fragrance can be described as camphor with an earthy undertone that helps soothe aching muscles or the brain fog that can develop due to physical exertion.</p>
